# 🎲 FateDice: JudgementRoll 👁️‍🗨️

> _"So? Are you brave enough to answer 'yes'?  
Or will you crawl away like the rest — a forgotten glitch in fate’s code?"_

---

**FateDice: JudgementRoll** is a terminal-based Java game where you're not just rolling dice — you're defying fate itself. The terminal becomes your stage, the compiler your demon, and the dice... your judge. This isn’t just a game — it’s a cursed ceremony of anime monologues, snarky sarcasm, and 6-sided doom.
